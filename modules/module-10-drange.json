    {
      "question": "What is dynamic range in photography?",
      "options": [
        "The range of focal lengths your lens can zoom",
        "The range between the darkest and brightest tones a camera can capture at once",
        "The sharpness across the frame",
        "The color gamut of the sensor"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "DR = dark-to-bright span the camera can record without losing detail."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which scene usually has high dynamic range (hard to expose in one shot)?",
      "options": [
        "Overcast sky and evenly lit subject",
        "Bright sky with a dark foreground at sunset",
        "Indoor scene with soft lamps",
        "Studio portrait with softbox"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Bright sky + dark land = big brightness gap → high DR."
    },
    {
      "question": "On the histogram, blown highlights are indicated by:",
      "options": [
        "A tall spike in the center",
        "Data piled up hard against the right edge",
        "Data piled up hard against the left edge",
        "A gap on both sides"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Right edge = highlight clipping; left edge = shadow clipping."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're losing detail in the bright sky. Easiest first step?",
      "options": [
        "Increase ISO",
        "Open the aperture",
        "Dial negative exposure compensation (e.g., −1 EV)",
        "Add +1 EV compensation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Go brighter ( +EV ) to lift shadows, darker ( −EV ) to save highlights."

      "question": "For maximum editing flexibility with dynamic range, shoot:",
      "options": [
        "PNG",
        "RAW",
        "JPEG (Normal)",
        "GIF"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "RAW files retain more highlight/shadow detail."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which typically reduces a camera's usable dynamic range?",
      "options": [
        "Using a tripod",
        "Stopping down from f/4 to f/8",
        "Raising ISO far above base ISO",
        "Switching to manual focus"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Higher ISO usually lowers DR (less highlight headroom, more noise)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is HDR / exposure bracketing most helpful?",
      "options": [
        "Static scenes with bright sky + dark foreground",
        "Sports action",
        "Windy fields of grass",
        "Fast-moving crowds"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "HDR works best when little moves between frames."
    },
    {
      "question": "Outdoor backlit portrait (bright sky behind, face in shade) without bracketing—what helps keep both usable?",
      "options": [
        "Spot meter the sky and keep it dark",
        "Expose a bit for the highlights (−EV) and add fill (flash/reflector), or lift shadows later",
        "Always meter the face only",
        "Raise ISO to brighten everything"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Protect highlights then fill/brighten shadows."
    },
    {
      "question": "A graduated ND filter is most useful when:",
      "options": [
        "The whole scene is uniformly dark",
        "The sky is much brighter than the land",
        "Shooting indoor portraits",
        "Panning action shots"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Grad ND darkens the sky so exposure fits the camera's DR."
    },
    {
      "question": "Expose To The Right (ETTR) means:",
      "options": [
        "Overexpose until the image looks white",
        "Place the histogram as far right as possible without clipping",
        "Always use +2 EV",
        "Always shoot at ISO 6400"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "ETTR aims for brighter (noise-cleaner) exposure without blowing highlights."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement is most accurate about dynamic range vs. contrast?",
      "options": [
        "They're the same thing",
        "Contrast is how tones are distributed/appear; DR is the camera's capture limits",
        "Higher contrast always means higher DR",
        "DR is only about color saturation"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Contrast = look; DR = recordable range."
    },
    {
      "question": "In post-processing of a RAW file with bright clouds just below clipping, which control is most helpful?",
      "options": [
        "Clarity +100",
        "Reduce Highlights / pull back Highlights",
        "Add heavy vignette",
        "Increase Contrast"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Highlights slider helps recover near-clipped bright areas."
