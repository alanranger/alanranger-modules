        "Image noise/grain",

      "options": [
        "Makes it darker",
        "Makes it brighter",
        "Changes white balance",
        "Zooms the lens"

      "correct": 1,

        "Perfect exposure",

        "Underexposure",

        "Highlights are blown out (overexposed)",
        "Wrong autofocus mode"

      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Right clipping = lost highlight detail."

      "question": "What is depth of field?",
      "options": [
        "The camera’s dynamic range",
        "The range of distances that appears acceptably sharp in the photo",
