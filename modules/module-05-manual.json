    {
      "question": "What does Manual (M) mode mean?",
      "options": [
        "The camera chooses shutter and aperture, you choose ISO",
        "You choose shutter, aperture, and ISO",
        "Only ISO is manual, the rest is automatic",
        "The camera uses exposure compensation to set brightness"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Review Manual mode overview—you control shutter, aperture, and ISO (not the camera)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is Manual mode most helpful?",
      "options": [
        "Rapidly changing stage lights where every shot is different",
        "Very steady lighting and a series of similar shots",
        "Random street scenes where each frame varies",
        "When you want the camera to adjust each shot for you"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "See When to use Manual—steady light + consistent results across shots."

      "question": "You want shallow background blur for portraits but consistent brightness. What should you set first in Manual?",
      "options": [
        "Aperture to the f-number you want for the look",
        "ISO to the lowest number",
        "Shutter to 1/1000s",
        "White balance"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Start with your creative priority—set aperture first, then match exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "In pure Manual with Auto ISO OFF, what does Exposure Compensation (±) do?",
      "options": [
        "It changes brightness by itself",
        "It changes ISO automatically",
        "Nothing—it's ignored",
        "It changes white balance"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Exposure compensation in Manual only has effect if Auto ISO is ON."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your test shot is too dark by about one stop. You need to keep the same depth of field and your shutter is still safe. What's the easiest fix?",
      "options": [
        "Open the aperture (changes your DOF)",
        "Slow the shutter by one stop",
        "Lower ISO",
        "Change white balance"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Stops & shutter—add one stop of light by slowing the shutter one stop."

      "question": "What mainly freezes motion?",
      "options": [
        "Lower ISO",
        "Faster shutter speed",
        "Smaller aperture (higher f-number)",
        "Image stabilization alone"

      "question": "Which setting gives more background blur?",
      "options": [
        "f/5.6",
        "f/8",
        "f/2.8",
        "f/16"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Aperture & depth of field—lower f-number = more blur."
    },
    {
      "question": "You've set f/2.8 and 1/250s for the look you want, but the photo is still too dark. What keeps the same DOF and motion while brightening?",
      "options": [
        "Raise ISO",
        "Open to f/2.0",
        "Slow to 1/60s",
        "Turn on HDR"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "ISO & exposure—raise ISO to brighten without changing DOF or motion."

    {
      "question": "Your subject is backlit and their face is dark. In Manual, what should you do?",
      "options": [
        "Keep the meter centered; it will be fine",
        "Open up / slow shutter / raise ISO until the subject is correctly exposed",
        "Use AE-Lock only",
        "Only lower ISO"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Backlit subjects—expose for the subject, not the bright background."
    },
    {
      "question": "Manual with Auto ISO ON and +1 EC: what happens?",
      "options": [
        "The camera ignores exposure compensation",
        "ISO goes lower to darken",
        "ISO increases to brighten by ~1 stop",
        "Shutter speeds get slower automatically"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Manual + Auto ISO—EC biases the ISO brighter/darker."
    },
    {
      "question": "You change from f/4 → f/5.6 (one stop less light) but want motion blur to stay similar. What compensates?",
      "options": [
        "Slow shutter one stop (adds blur)",
        "Raise ISO one stop (e.g., 100 → 200)",
        "Speed up shutter one stop",
        "Close aperture another stop"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Equivalent exposures—to keep shutter (motion) the same, raise ISO one stop."
