    {
      "question": "What's the basic difference between full frame and crop sensor cameras?",
      "options": [
        "Full frame uses film; crop uses digital",
        "Full frame has a larger sensor; crop sensor is smaller (e.g., APS-C)",
        "Crop sensors have more megapixels",
        "Full frame changes a lens's focal length"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Sensor size differs → affects field of view, noise, and depth of field."
    },
    {
      "question": "A 50 mm lens on a 1.5× crop camera gives a field of view similar to which lens on full frame?",
      "options": [
        "35 mm",
        "50 mm",
        "75 mm",
        "85 mm"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "\"Equivalent focal length\" = lens × crop factor (50 × 1.5 = 75)."
    },
    {
      "question": "You frame the same head-and-shoulders portrait at f/2.8 on both cameras (adjusting distance/focal length to match framing). Which gives shallower depth of field?",
      "options": [
        "Full frame",
        "Crop sensor",
        "They're identical",
        "Depends only on the lens brand"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "For same framing & f-number, full frame tends to have shallower DOF."
    },
    {
      "question": "In low light at higher ISOs, which typically shows less noise (cleaner images), all else equal?",
      "options": [
        "Full frame",
        "Crop sensor",
        "Both the same",
        "Depends only on shutter speed"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Larger sensors usually have better high-ISO performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "For wildlife/sports, which body gives a feeling of extra \"reach\" with the same 300 mm lens (tighter framing without cropping later)?",
      "options": [
        "Full frame",
        "Crop sensor",
        "Both the same",
        "Depends on stabilization"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Crop factor narrows FOV → subjects look closer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which makes it easier to go ultra-wide with the same focal length lens?",
      "options": [
        "Full frame",
        "Crop sensor",
        "Both the same",
        "Depends only on aperture"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Crop factor trims the wide end; full frame keeps it wider."
    },
    {
      "question": "About mounting crop-only lenses (e.g., EF-S/DX) on full-frame bodies:",
      "options": [
        "Always works perfectly",
        "Often not mountable or causes heavy vignetting—use full-frame lenses on full-frame bodies",
        "Improves image quality",
        "Increases focal length"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Use FF lenses for FF bodies; crop-only lenses are not designed for FF coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Cost & size comparison (same generation/quality level):",
      "options": [
        "Crop bodies/lenses are usually larger and pricier",
        "Full-frame bodies/lenses are generally bigger, heavier, and more expensive",
        "Both systems cost the same",
        "Only lenses differ, not bodies"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Full-frame systems often mean bigger/ heavier gear and higher cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does a crop sensor change a lens's actual focal length?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, it multiplies the lens's focal length",
        "No—focal length stays the same; the sensor just captures a narrower field of view",
        "Only at high ISO",
        "Only in video mode"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Crop factor affects field of view, not actual focal length."
    },
    {
      "question": "Two cameras are both 24 MP (one full frame, one APS-C). Which typically has larger pixels and can show less noise at the same ISO?",
      "options": [
        "Full frame",
        "Crop sensor",
        "They must be identical",
        "Depends only on brand"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Same MP on larger sensor → bigger pixel pitch, often cleaner at high ISO."
