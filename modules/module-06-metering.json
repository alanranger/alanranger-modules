    {
      "question": "What does camera metering do?",
      "options": [
        "Measures light reflected from the scene to suggest exposure settings",
        "Measures color for white balance",
        "Sets autofocus points",
        "Changes picture style"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Metering basics—the meter reads reflected light and guides exposure."

    {
      "question": "Evaluative/Matrix metering is best described as…",
      "options": [
        "A tiny spot at the focus point",
        "Only the center is measured",
        "The camera looks at the whole frame and balances it for a general scene",
        "It ignores the background completely"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Matrix/Evaluative—good all-rounder that considers most of the frame."
    },
    {
      "question": "Center-weighted metering means…",
      "options": [
        "Only 1–5% of the frame is measured",
        "The center area is given more importance, with the rest averaged in",
        "The whole frame is treated equally",
        "It only works in Manual mode"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Center-weighted—prioritizes the middle while still considering the surroundings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Spot metering…",
      "options": [
        "Ignores the subject",
        "Measures a very small area (≈1–5%), often at the focus point or center",
        "Is the same as center-weighted",
        "Is only for landscapes"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Spot—tiny area reading; great for tricky lighting on faces or small subjects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your subject is backlit and looks dark in Evaluative/Matrix. Quickest fix without changing mode?",
      "options": [
        "Close the aperture",
        "Lower ISO",
        "Dial + exposure compensation (e.g., +1 to +2 EV)",
        "Use a faster shutter"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Backlit + EC—add +EV so the face isn't a silhouette."
    },
    {
      "question": "You meter off a very dark coat with Spot. If you trust that reading without compensation, the photo will likely be…",
      "options": [
        "Too dark",
        "Too bright (the meter tries to make it mid-gray)",
        "Perfect",
        "Very blue"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Subject tones—dark things get over-bright unless you add negative EC."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does snow or a white beach often look gray when you rely on the meter?",
      "options": [
        "The lens is dirty",
        "The ISO is too high",
        "The meter assumes what it sees should be mid-gray",
        "Auto white balance is off"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "18% gray idea—add +EC for bright scenes to keep whites white."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does *AE-Lock (AEL / ) do?",
      "options": [
        "Locks focus only",
        "Locks the exposure you just metered so you can recompose",
        "Changes to Spot temporarily",
        "Sets Auto ISO"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "AE-Lock—meter from the right place, lock exposure, then recompose."

      "question": "Small bird against a bright sky—which metering helps you expose the bird?",
      "options": [
        "Center-weighted",
        "Evaluative/Matrix",
        "Spot on the bird",
        "Highlight-weighted off the sky"

      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Small subject + bright background—Spot meter the subject."

    {
      "question": "After metering and shooting, what's the best check to avoid clipping?",
      "options": [
        "Picture style",
        "White balance",
        "Histogram for blown highlights/shadows",
        "Image stabilization status"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Histogram—use it to see if tones are crushed or blown."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Manual mode (Auto ISO OFF), the meter mainly…",
      "options": [
        "Changes your shutter speed automatically",
        "Changes your aperture automatically",
        "Shows where you are vs. \"metered\" exposure—you adjust the triangle",
        "Applies exposure compensation on its own"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Manual + meter—it's a guide; you move shutter/aperture/ISO."
    },
    {
      "question": "When might Center-weighted be a smart choice?",
      "options": [
        "Portraits where the subject is near the middle and background varies",
        "Tiny birds against bright skies",
        "Cityscapes with even light across the frame",
        "Fast sports under flickering lights"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Choosing modes—center-weighted is simple and reliable for centered subjects."
