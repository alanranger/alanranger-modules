        "How bright the picture is (exposure)",
        "How the camera takes shots when you press the shutter (single, burst, timer, etc.)",
        "How fast autofocus works",
        "ISO behaviour"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Drive mode = single, continuous/burst, self-timer, remote, etc."

      "question": "You're photographing fast sports and want multiple frames to catch the peak action. Which drive mode?",
      "options": [

        "Continuous High (burst)",
        "Quiet shutter"

      "reviewHint": "Burst fires many frames quickly—great for action."

      "options": [

        "Self-timer 2 seconds (or \"shutter delay\")",
        "Single shot",
        "Scene mode"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "A 2s timer lets vibrations settle before the exposure."

      "question": "You're taking a group photo and need time to step into the frame. Which drive mode?",
      "options": [
        "Single shot",
        "Self-timer 10 seconds",
        "Continuous Low",
        "Bracketing"

      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "10s timer gives you time to get in place."

    {
      "question": "A common trade-off when using continuous/burst shooting is:",
      "options": [
        "The lens stops focusing",
        "The camera's buffer fills, then shooting slows",
        "ISO changes by itself",
        "Metering turns off"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Long bursts can fill the buffer → the camera slows while writing."

    {
      "question": "You want the camera to take 3 different exposures in one press (e.g., for HDR later). What feature should you use?",
      "options": [
        "Continuous High only",
        "Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB/BKT)",
        "Self-timer 2s only",
        "Silent shutter only"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Enable AEB/BKT; many cameras shoot the set in burst or timer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Silent/quiet (electronic) shutter drive is great when you must be discreet. What's a possible downside?",
      "options": [
        "It reduces image resolution",
        "Can cause banding under some artificial lights or distort fast motion",
        "It turns off stabilization",
        "Colors become inaccurate"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Electronic shutters may show banding/rolling-shutter artifacts."

      "question": "You're photographing kids' portraits and want a few frames per moment without flooding the card or buffer. Best choice?",

        "Continuous Low (short bursts)",
        "Self-timer 10s",
        "Bracketing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Low-speed burst = several frames, easy on buffer, great for expressions."
