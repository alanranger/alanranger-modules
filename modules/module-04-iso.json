    {
      "question": "What does ISO actually control in a digital camera?",
      "options": [
        "The physical sensitivity of the sensor",
        "The amount of light the lens transmits",
        "The amplification of the sensor's signal after capture",
        "The color temperature of the image"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "ISO = signal gain, not lens light or white balance."

      "question": "Going from ISO 100 → ISO 400 equals…",
      "options": [
        "Half a stop",

        "Two stops",
        "Four stops"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Each doubling = +1 stop (100→200→400 = +2 stops)."

      "question": "As ISO increases (all else equal), which artifact increases most?",
      "options": [
        "Motion blur",
        "Diffraction",
        "Image noise/grain",
        "Perspective distortion"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Higher ISO → more visible noise, especially in shadows."
    },
    {
      "question": "Best everyday practice with ISO is to…",
      "options": [
        "Always shoot base ISO, even if motion blurs",
        "Use the lowest ISO that still gives the shutter/aperture you need",
        "Always use Auto ISO",
        "Use maximum ISO and denoise later"

      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Balance clean image vs. needed shutter/aperture."

        "100",
        "12,800"

      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Many cameras have base ISO ≈ 100 (some ≈ 64 or 200)."

      "question": "Indoors at 1/30s, f/2.8, ISO 100, your subject is blurry from motion. Quickest fix (same mode) is to…",
      "options": [
        "Raise ISO",
        "Stop down to f/5.6",
        "Lower ISO",
        "Turn off stabilization"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Higher ISO lets you use a faster shutter to freeze motion."

      "question": "In Aperture Priority with Auto ISO and a minimum shutter set, as light drops (and max ISO isn't reached) the camera will…",
      "options": [
        "Open the aperture further",
        "Go below your min shutter",
        "Raise ISO",
        "Apply exposure compensation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Auto ISO tries to hold your min shutter by increasing ISO."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does ISO change depth of field or perspective?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, higher ISO gives shallower depth of field",
        "No—ISO doesn't change DoF or perspective",
        "Yes, higher ISO compresses perspective",
        "Yes, lower ISO increases background blur"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "ISO only affects signal gain/brightness, not optics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your photo at ISO 6400 looks noisy. Next time, what helps reduce noise most?",
      "options": [
        "Use a lower ISO with a longer shutter (tripod/brace)",
        "Use a smaller aperture (higher f-number)",
        "Increase ISO further and denoise later",
        "Switch to JPEG"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Lower ISO generally = cleaner file (if you can stabilize)."
    },
    {
      "question": "With manual flash power fixed, increasing ISO from 200 → 400 will…",
      "options": [
        "Brighten ambient but not flash exposure",
        "Brighten both ambient and flash-lit areas by one stop",
        "Only change white balance",
        "Reduce the effective flash power"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "ISO boosts all recorded light, including flash."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement about Auto ISO is accurate?",
      "options": [
        "It changes aperture automatically",
        "It adjusts ISO (within limits) to maintain exposure/min shutter",
        "It turns off the light meter",
        "It locks ISO to base"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Auto ISO raises/lowers ISO automatically within your limits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Start at 1/60s, f/4, ISO 100. You change to ISO 400 (+2 stops). To keep the same exposure, which shutter?",
      "options": [
        "1/15s",
        "1/30s",
        "1/60s",
        "1/250s"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "reviewHint": "+2 stops ISO → make shutter 2 stops faster (1/60 → 1/125 → 1/250)."
