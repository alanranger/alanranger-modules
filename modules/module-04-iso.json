      "question": "What does ISO actually control in a digital camera?",
      "options": [
        "The physical sensitivity of the sensor",

        "The amplification of the sensor's signal after capture",
        "The color temperature of the image"

      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "ISO boosts (amplifies) the sensor signal; it doesn't change the lens or sensor physics."

      "question": "You're at 1/60s, f/4, ISO 100. To freeze action at 1/250s (two stops faster) while keeping f/4, what ISO gives the same exposure?",
      "options": [
        "ISO 200",
        "ISO 400",
        "ISO 800",

      "id": "q7",
      "question": "In Aperture Priority with Auto ISO (min shutter 1/250s, max ISO not yet reached), what does the camera change first as light drops?",

        "It opens the aperture",
        "It slows below the min shutter",
        "It raises ISO",
        "It applies exposure compensation"

      "options": [
        "Higher ISO increases highlight headroom",
        "Higher ISO generally reduces dynamic range",
        "ISO doesn't affect dynamic range",
        "Lower ISO always increases shadow noise"

      "question": "On an ISO-invariant camera, which approach best preserves highlights while yielding similar noise?",
      "options": [
        "Raise ISO in-camera instead of pushing in post",
        "Shoot at lower ISO to protect highlights, then brighten in post",

        "Use Auto ISO with +2 EV compensation"

      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "With ISO-invariant sensors, pushing in post is similar in noise while protecting highlights."
