        "Using Auto ISO only",
        "Changing white balance across frames"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Bracketing = multiple exposures so you can pick/merge later."

      "question": "A common bracketing step size is:",
      "options": [
        "⅓ EV only",
        "½ EV only",
        "±1 EV per step is very common",

      "question": "When does bracketing help most?",
      "options": [
        "In a studio with controlled soft light",
        "At noon on a cloudy day",
        "High-contrast scenes (bright sky + dark foreground)",
        "Macro shots with flash"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "Use bracketing when dynamic range is too high for one shot."

      "reviewHint": "Many HDR workflows start with −2/0/+2 EV."

      "question": "How can you reduce ghosting (moving leaves/water) when bracketing?",
      "options": [
        "Turn off burst shooting",
        "Use a long self-timer for each frame",
        "Use a tripod + high-speed burst; enable de-ghosting when merging",
        "Only shoot the +2 EV frame"

      "reviewHint": "Tripod + fast sequence + de-ghosting helps align motion."

        "Aperture Priority (A/Av)"

      "correct": 3,
      "reviewHint": "In Av, aperture stays fixed; camera varies shutter."

      "question": "When is bracketing usually unnecessary?",
      "options": [
        "Evenly lit scene with no clipping on the histogram",

        "Backlit subject against a bright window",
        "Night cityscape with bright signs"

      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "If one exposure fits the scene's range, no bracket needed."

      "question": "AEB set to 5 frames, 1 EV steps in Av. Base is 1/60s, f/4, ISO 200. Which shutter sequence fits?",
