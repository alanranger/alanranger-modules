    {
      "question": "What is focal length?",
      "options": [
        "The distance from your subject to the camera",
        "The distance (at infinity focus) from the lens's optical center to the sensor",
        "The size of the camera sensor",
        "The diameter of the lens mount"

      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Focal length is a property of the lens, defined at infinity focus."

      "question": "As focal length increases, your field of view…",
      "options": [
        "Gets wider",

        "Stays the same",
        "Only changes on crop-sensor cameras"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Longer focal length = narrower FOV."

      "options": [
        "Perspective changes a lot",
        "Framing gets tighter (subject looks bigger); perspective doesn't change because you didn't move",
        "Depth of field becomes identical to 35 mm",
        "The lens becomes \"faster\""
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Perspective depends on camera position, not focal length."

      "question": "What primarily controls perspective (how near/far objects appear relative to each other)?",
      "options": [
        "Focal length",
        "Aperture",
        "Camera-to-subject distance (where you stand)",
        "ISO"

        "85 mm",

        "85 mm",
        "200 mm"

      "reviewHint": "85 mm is a classic head-and-shoulders choice."

    {
      "question": "Which is true about zoom vs prime lenses?",
      "options": [
        "A prime has variable focal length; zoom is fixed",
        "A prime has a fixed focal length (often smaller, faster); a zoom covers a range",
        "Primes can't be sharp",
        "Zooms always have wider maximum apertures"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Primes = fixed FL, often wider max aperture; zooms = flexible framing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does focal length itself create \"background compression\"?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, longer focal length compresses regardless of distance",
        "No—\"compression\" mainly comes from standing farther away; longer FLs are often used because you step back",
        "Only aperture creates compression",
        "Only sensor size creates compression"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Compression look = greater camera distance (perspective), not FL alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Your lens won't focus on a very close subject at 200 mm. Most likely you're…",
      "options": [
        "At the wrong ISO",
        "Inside the lens's minimum focus distance—step back or use macro gear",
        "Exceeding the shutter rule",
        "Using too small an aperture"

      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Every lens has a minimum focus distance (MFD)."

      "question": "Without moving the camera and at the same f-number, increasing focal length generally makes the background look…",
      "options": [
        "Sharper",
        "More blurred (stronger background blur)",
        "Unchanged",
        "More distorted"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Longer FL at same position & f-number → greater subject magnification → more blur."
