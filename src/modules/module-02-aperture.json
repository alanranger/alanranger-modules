        "It takes longer to collect the same quantity of light",

        "The image becomes overexposed",
        "The image sharpness decreases"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Small apertures have narrow openings, so they collect light more slowly."

      "options": [
        "It makes the background more blurred",
        "It makes the background more defined",
        "It eliminates the background completely",
        "It has no effect on the background"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Small apertures increase depth of field, making backgrounds more defined."

      "options": [
        "f/11",

        "f/4",
        "f/2.8"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "reviewHint": "The widest aperture (smallest f-stop number) creates the shallowest depth of field."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the diaphragm in a camera lens?",
      "options": [
        "To focus the image",
        "To control the aperture opening",
        "To stabilize the lens",
        "To filter light colors"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "The diaphragm is the mechanical component that opens and closes to control the aperture size."

      "question": "What is the term used to describe the circular opening that controls the aperture?",
      "options": [

        "Shutter",
        "Filter"

      "reviewHint": "The diaphragm is the mechanical device that creates the aperture opening."

    {
      "question": "If you change the aperture from f/5.6 to f/16, how does this affect exposure time?",
      "options": [
        "Increases exposure time",
        "Decreases exposure time",
        "No change to exposure time",
        "Doubles exposure time"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "Moving to a smaller aperture (higher f-stop) requires longer exposure time to collect the same amount of light."

    {
      "question": "What is the 'sweet spot' of a lens?",
      "options": [
        "The widest aperture of the lens",
        "The aperture at which the lens produces the sharpest image",
        "The aperture with the most bokeh",
        "The smallest aperture of the lens"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "The sweet spot is typically 2-3 stops down from the widest aperture, where the lens performs at its sharpest."
