    {
      "question": "What's the main difference between RAW and JPEG?",
      "options": [
        "RAW is a video format; JPEG is a photo format",
        "RAW is already edited; JPEG is unprocessed",
        "RAW is minimally processed sensor data; JPEG is processed and compressed in-camera",
        "RAW has fewer colors than JPEG"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "RAW = more data, less processing; JPEG = processed & compressed."
    },

      "question": "Which file is usually smaller straight out of the camera?",
      "options": [
        "RAW",
        "JPEG",
        "RAW+JPEG",
        "TIFF"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "JPEG compresses, so file sizes are smaller."
    },

      "question": "You shot under tungsten light with the wrong white balance. Which file lets you fix WB most easily after the shot?",
      "options": [
        "RAW",
        "JPEG",
        "PNG",
        "HEIF"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "RAW keeps full WB flexibility; JPEG bakes WB."
    },
    {
      "question": "To recover highlights/shadows and handle high contrast scenes, which gives you the most dynamic range?",
      "options": [
        "RAW",
        "JPEG",
        "RAW+JPEG",
        "Both the same"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "reviewHint": "RAW usually stores more highlight/shadow detail."
    },

      "question": "You need images ready to share quickly with pleasing contrast and sharpening without editing. Best choice?",
      "options": [
        "RAW",
        "JPEG",
        "RAW+JPEG",
        "TIFF"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "JPEG has in-camera processing (contrast, color, sharpening)."
    },

      "question": "Which settings are baked into JPEG but not into the underlying RAW data (only noted as metadata)?",
      "options": [
        "ISO & aperture",
        "Picture Style/Creative Style (contrast, saturation, sharpening)",
        "Focal length",
        "Shutter count"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Style settings affect JPEG rendering, RAW keeps data for later edits."

      "question": "For long bursts (sports/wildlife), which typically maintains buffer longer at the same quality level?",
      "options": [
        "RAW",
        "JPEG",
        "RAW+JPEG",
        "TIFF"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Smaller JPEG files = longer bursts before buffer fills."
    },
    {
      "question": "Typical bit depth comparison out of camera:",
      "options": [
        "JPEG 16-bit, RAW 8-bit",
        "JPEG 12-bit, RAW 8-bit",
        "JPEG 8-bit, RAW 12- or 14-bit (camera-dependent)",
        "Both are 10-bit"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "RAW usually has higher bit depth → more tonal precision."
    },
    {
      "question": "You're shooting a difficult, high-contrast sunset and plan to edit later. Best choice?",
      "options": [
        "JPEG only",
        "RAW only",
        "TIFF only",
        "HEIF only"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "Use RAW for maximum recovery latitude."

    {
      "question": "You must shoot and deliver quickly at an event with minimal editing. Best choice?",
      "options": [
        "RAW only",
        "TIFF only",
        "JPEG only",
        "RAW+TIFF"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "reviewHint": "JPEG is fast, small, ready-to-share."
    },
    {
      "question": "You want both flexibility for editing and a ready-to-share file from the same shot. What should you set?",
      "options": [
        "RAW",
        "JPEG",
        "TIFF",
        "RAW+JPEG"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "reviewHint": "RAW+JPEG gives an editable RAW plus an instant JPEG."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement about noise reduction and sharpening is most accurate?",
      "options": [
        "RAW files are always noisier in the final image",
        "JPEG has in-camera NR/sharpening baked in; RAW leaves you to adjust these in editing",
        "Both bake NR/sharpening permanently",
        "RAW cannot be sharpened"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "reviewHint": "JPEG bakes NR/sharpening; RAW offers control in post."
